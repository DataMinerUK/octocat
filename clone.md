Explain what git clone does, in your own words
==============================================

Git clone creates an exact copy, in the exact same state, of a repository on git hub on your own local machine. It maintains the link between local and the repo on Github such that any changes you, or any others who have a version on their machine, make can be added to the master repo on Github. It allows muliple people to work on the same code base, keeping track of all the different versions and allowing them to be merged.

Example
-------

`git clone https://github.com/DataMinerUK/octocat.git`
