Explain what a branch is, in your own words
============================================

Branching allows a code base to be split at a point in time where at that point in time they are exactly the same but from then on they can be worked on differently. For instance, your own styling can be applied to someone else's app. These changes you would not want to push back to the master repo.

Example
-------

* `git checkout -b answers` # Makes a new branch called "answers"
* `git push origin answers` # Pushes the branch to Github
